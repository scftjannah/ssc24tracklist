# ssc24tracklist

(Description)

For Swift Student Challenge this year, I decided to make a music review app that is called 'Tracklist'. One of the reasons that I wanted to make the app is how limited the number of music review apps on the App Store is and how everybody also thinks the same on social media. Because of that, I decided to make an app to make music reviews feel much simpler and accessible to anyone.
 
The app has several features and elements for the list, including the title, artist, genre, rating, and review. On the sheet, it also has a bunch of review prompts to get started as a guide for the user. The app also has a chart feature to present the information from the list depending on their own categories.
 
I use multiple frameworks for the app. I use SwiftUI for the most part, together with SwiftData for storing list data and Swift Charts to present information as a bunch of charts.
 
I hope that this app could help anyone’s need to share whatever music they've been listening to, and that it could also bring people closer to themselves through their music taste and thoughts.
